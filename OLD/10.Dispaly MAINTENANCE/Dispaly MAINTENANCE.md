# Troubleshooting for MAINTENANCE Mode

**<span class="mark">1.Problem</span>**

Recently, many users encounter the issue that Micro:bit board doesn’t
respond when connected to computer.

If the way you operate is correct, maybe you accidentally press the
reset button and enter the Maintenance mode or lead to lose the firmware
due to misoperation.

Plug in Micro:bit board, the“MAINTENANCE”drive appears. That means the
program can’t be downloaded.
