**<span class="mark">1.Overview</span>**

Micro:bit is a single chip microcomputer with ARM architecture designed
by BBC, which is half the size of a credit card. However, it integrates
a Bluetooth, an accelerometer, a compass, three buttons, a 5 x 5 LED dot
matrix as well as a microphone.

The micro:bit designed by BBC is committed to getting teenagers involved
in creative hardware and software programming via it.

Micro:bit boasts many open source libraries and interesting solutions
that you can check out on the website：

For your convenience, we designed a bottom board of the car and
integrated all kinds of sensors needed on it.

This product is designed for the micro:bit V2 board. Please use a V2
development board for control. (If the V1.5 development board is used,
some functions will be incompatible.)

**<span class="mark">1.Overview</span>**

The expansion board integrates an IR receiver, a photoresistor, a line tracking sensor, RGB LEDs, an ultrasonic port, an IIC interface, a serial port communication port as well as motors. Moreover, it introduces eight IO ports for subsequent expansion.

Due to the small number of IO ports of micro:bit, the micro:bit board sends control instructions to STC8G1K08 via the IIC, and then ST8G1K08 sends PWM to control HR8833 motor to drive IC, thus controlling the motor to rotate. LED RGB is controlled in the same way as above.

**<span class="mark">2.Parameters</span>**

- Connector port input: DC 4.5V

- Motor speed: 200RPM

- Working temperature range: 0-50℃

- Dimension: 99\*78\*58mm

- Environmental protection attributes: ROHS
